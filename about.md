Hello! I'm Praneet, a 4th-year student at the University of Queensland.  
I'm specializing in [Software Engineering](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-engineering-honours-2455/software-engineering-softwe2455). 
I've also been a teaching assistant for [CSSE2002 - Programming in the Large](https://programs-courses.uq.edu.au/course.html?course_code=CSSE2002).  
I love programming and building hardware!
